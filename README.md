# WPML Better Flags

Replaces flag images with higher quality flat ones.

This plugin uses a very simple workflow, to replace the default WPML Flags.

-   Is the flag a default flag? (only if the url is part of the wpml plugin folder)
    -   Does our plugin have a flag with the same filename?
        -   If yes to both of the above, replace it with our plugin.

This workflow also makes sure that, if this is a custom flag you uploaded, it will not be replaced.

I had a hard time finding the correct filters to change the flags, so if there are some areas where it does not work, feel free to contribute!

Some flags are also not yet added, or may have wrong filenames, and will therefore not replace the defaults. Once again, always feel free to contribute!

If flags are missing, check the link below, as the flag you are looking for is most likely available from the pack.
